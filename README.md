## The Test Page

This is just a boring old markdown readme with no actual information about anything. Just some ramblings to see how the format is looking.

### Ooh Look, a Subheading

There's some more text here under that header that's a little smaller than the header that's above it. Kinda like a subsection you could say.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

This page is using a theme that I selected, how wild is that. Just clicked a few buttons on my fitbit.
